There are various ways a supermarket can price their goods, which will affect the underlying data modeling. These scenarios will need to be handled:

Product X costs Y
X number of products for Y price
Y price per X unit of measure
Get free Z product(s) X with purchase of Y product(s) X
X% discount with purchase of Y product(s)
X% discount off additional product X with purchase of Y product(s) X
Get X products for the cost of Y products
X% off select products
X amount off select products
X% off when spending Y or more

I will use a relational model as a starting point, since a document model doesn't really make sense here and I'm not too familiar with others like hierarchical or network data models. 

My first thought is that 'raw' prices should be decoupled from the existing deals. Products can be modeled initially in a simple way with columns product_id, name, cost, and unit_type. unit_type would refer to how the product quantity is measured, e.g. per unit, per X length (maybe for fabrics), or per pound, etc. Deals will be a bit harder to model, as there are many different types of deals.
